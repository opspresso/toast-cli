# Project Code Guidelines

## Core Principles

- **Focus on the problem**: Avoid unnecessary complexity or expanding the scope.
- **Prefer standard solutions**: Use standard libraries and documented patterns before creating custom ones.
- **Write clean code**: Use meaningful names and organize code clearly.
- **Maintain consistent style**: Follow a consistent code style throughout the project. Use formatters (e.g. Prettier, Black) and linters (e.g. ESLint, Flake8) to enforce it.
- **Handle errors gracefully**: Address edge cases and ensure robustness.
- **Comment when needed**: Add comments for complex logic, but keep code self-explanatory whenever possible.

## Documentation Standards

- Keep `README.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` up to date.
- `README.md` should include:
  - Project overview
  - Setup instructions
  - Usage examples
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` should cover:
  - System design
  - Component relationships
  - Data flow

## Testing Strategy

- Write unit tests for individual functions and modules.
- Add integration tests to validate interactions between components.
- Ensure critical paths are well covered by tests.
- Integrate automated testing into the development workflow.
